    "\n",
    "1. By very low population the changes will be very slow and the diversity is low, so it may take a lot of time to converge\n",
    "By very high population the calculations will be a lot and the memory complexity will rise as well, also its possible for repetitive chromosomes to occure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if the population grows in each generation, if the algorithm goes on for many generations the population will lean to infinity and the calculation time will rise and consume all of the computaional resouces. But it can lead to a better percision if it converges befor the calculation overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Crossover should merge some well-performing chromosomes and mutation applies changes to a single chromosome. both will help to converge to the optimal answer, crossover does this at a lower rate by keeping the possible features of a good solution. mutation does this semi-randomly. If mutation is totally random it could remove the features of a good answer and diverge. but by keeping the mutation steps small this problem could be solved(not totally random replacement, but instead minor changes to each bit)\n",
    "a totally random mutation algorithm may not be efficient if used by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Having a good initialization could lead to less steps, for this problem it is possible to start where each operand is the midpoint if the goal is neither low or high, if its very low or very high we could set all the operands to min or max.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The main reason may be because of too much randomness in the model: if the fitness is too low and we are so close to the goal, the randomness may start to work against the algorithm and the chromosomes diverge, As stated in part 3, minor changes in mutation may help to fine-tuned moves, which can handle very small changes(as only 1 step in fitness diference) and solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We could set up a timer in the algorithm , as if the fitness stays on a certain number over some time ,we will assume that it's not possible to reach the goal and exit."
